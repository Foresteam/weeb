# Test cross-platform landing
Uses my own frontend library for component approach. I was originally intended to recreate Vue to some extent.

*Note: towebp is a script for converting images to webp, with compression*

## Setup
Install **Node.JS v16**, **yarn**.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Foresteam/weeb.git
cd weeb
yarn -D

```
